I work from home and I presently reside at this listing and I am available to answer any of your questions. My children are all grown up (this was not their home) and now I'm in a new space, I want to share it with interesting honest people. 

 My home is very clean and comfortable. Unfortunately, you cannot rent out my entire home and my yard is accessible. My home is also very secured and I have a few surveillance cameras and secure locks on all doors and windows. My neighborhood is a family neighborhood. Lots of large families live on this street. It has been a noisy summer, due too the fact these people CANNOT AFFORD VACATIONS OR TRAVEL, SO THEY HANG OUT AT HOME. Now since it that time of year where the children go back to school, the neighbor hood will become quiet again.

Now in my home there are seven rooms. You will have access to the first and second floors, unless your party requires my additional space, then the third floor can be used. I am very open to children and I have two heavy duty twin air mattresses (which are quite comfortable) and a spare bed in my office on the third floor if need be. (Pictures are not available due to this area being my private quarters!) And I do not have any pets, but I am open to small animals if they are house broken and will not destroy my home.

As my guest, I ask that you respect my things and my privacy and I will do the same. I love people and hope by opening up my home I get to meet some new life long friends! I promise you a comfy safe place and good whole foods! 

(And for parents of young people under 25, they WILL NOT have access to any alcohol. My bar is closed and locked! Just so you'll know and can feel at ease. There will no be consumption at my house!) 

ALSO LET ME ADD: For those who need transportation, I have a reliable driver with a 2015 Lincoln TownCar, Fully Insured and Licensed available for tours in NYC, transport from all area airports, etc to my location. My code is VAL0202, or you can make a reservation at www.Towncarusa.com or call him at 1-917-418-9198.

You also don't want to miss an opportunity to eat at a Brazilian restaurant in the Ironbound section.,https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/1ea7d294-b755-4253-85a6-daba431c79b1.jpg,257405231,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/257405231,Rebecca,2019-04-22,"Newark, NJ","I'm originally from Delaware and have been living in Newark since 2011.

I'm a proud New Yorker who has had the privilege of being shaped by the rich cultural tapestry that my heritage offers. My parents come from Egypt and the Dominican Republic, two countries with distinct cultures that have come together in a beautiful fusion.

Growing up in New York, I was exposed to a myriad of cultures, languages, and traditions. From the festivals and parades of the Caribbean and Latin America to the art and music of West Africa and South Asia, New York provided a glimpse into the world without ever leaving the city limits.

My Egyptian culture is deeply rooted in history, art, and religion. From the Pyramids of Giza to the cuisine with fragrant spices, herbs, and hearty dishes such as koshari, ful medames, and molokhia. Family is at the center of Egyptian culture, and gatherings are often filled with music, storytelling, and lively conversations.

The Dominican Republic, on the other hand, is known for its vibrant music, dance, and joyful celebrations. Merengue and bachata are a reflection of our spirit of rhythm and passion. The cuisine is a fusion of African, Spanish, and indigenous influences, with dishes such as mangu, sancocho, and chicharrón.

Growing up with these two rich cultures has given me a unique perspective on the world and a deep appreciation for diversity. I've been fortunate to experience the beauty of both Egyptian and Dominican cultures firsthand, from the traditional dances and music to the delicious cuisine and warm hospitality. These cultural influences, combined with the diversity of New York, have inspired me to explore other cultures and learn about their traditions and customs.

As I continue to travel and explore the world, I carry with me the richness and diversity of my heritage and the vibrancy of New York. I'm proud to share my cultural background with others, and I'm grateful for the opportunities that I've had to learn, grow, and connect with people from all over the world.",within an hour,100%,97%,,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-21500972/original/9738a59b-03fa-4bda-8a7d-f6d5e00322b9.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-21500972/original/9738a59b-03fa-4bda-8a7d-f6d5e00322b9.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Fordham Heights,7,8,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,"Newark, New Jersey, United States",Central,,40.7441851,-74.1842025,Private room in rental unit,Private room,1,,1 shared bath,,1,"[""Refrigerator"", ""Central heating"", ""Clothing storage: dresser"", ""Essentials"", ""Free washer \u2013 In building"", ""Kitchen"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Wifi"", ""Bed linens"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Backyard"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Hangers"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Bathtub"", ""Paid parking on premises"", ""Free dryer \u2013 In building"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Shared patio or balcony"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Self check-in"", ""Hot water"", ""TV"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Central air conditioning"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Smart lock""]",$30.00,30,365,30,30,1125,1125,30.0,1125.0,,t,8,8,8,191,2023-07-01,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,f,3,0,3,0,

I'm a proud New Yorker who has had the privilege of being shaped by the rich cultural tapestry that my heritage offers. My parents come from Egypt and the Dominican Republic, two countries with distinct cultures that have come together in a beautiful fusion.

Growing up in New York, I was exposed to a myriad of cultures, languages, and traditions. From the festivals and parades of the Caribbean and Latin America to the art and music of West Africa and South Asia, New York provided a glimpse into the world without ever leaving the city limits.

My Egyptian culture is deeply rooted in history, art, and religion. From the Pyramids of Giza to the cuisine with fragrant spices, herbs, and hearty dishes such as koshari, ful medames, and molokhia. Family is at the center of Egyptian culture, and gatherings are often filled with music, storytelling, and lively conversations.

The Dominican Republic, on the other hand, is known for its vibrant music, dance, and joyful celebrations. Merengue and bachata are a reflection of our spirit of rhythm and passion. The cuisine is a fusion of African, Spanish, and indigenous influences, with dishes such as mangu, sancocho, and chicharrón.

Growing up with these two rich cultures has given me a unique perspective on the world and a deep appreciation for diversity. I've been fortunate to experience the beauty of both Egyptian and Dominican cultures firsthand, from the traditional dances and music to the delicious cuisine and warm hospitality. These cultural influences, combined with the diversity of New York, have inspired me to explore other cultures and learn about their traditions and customs.

As I continue to travel and explore the world, I carry with me the richness and diversity of my heritage and the vibrancy of New York. I'm proud to share my cultural background with others, and I'm grateful for the opportunities that I've had to learn, grow, and connect with people from all over the world.",within an hour,100%,97%,,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-21500972/original/9738a59b-03fa-4bda-8a7d-f6d5e00322b9.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-21500972/original/9738a59b-03fa-4bda-8a7d-f6d5e00322b9.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Fordham Heights,7,8,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,"Newark, New Jersey, United States",Central,,40.74467,-74.18396,Private room in rental unit,Private room,2,,1 shared bath,,1,"[""Refrigerator"", ""Central heating"", ""Iron"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Free street parking"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Essentials"", ""Free washer \u2013 In building"", ""Dining table"", ""Kitchen"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Gas stove"", ""Wifi"", ""Bed linens"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Ethernet connection"", ""Single oven"", ""Freezer"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Hangers"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Microwave"", ""Bathtub"", ""Free dryer \u2013 In building"", ""Clothing storage"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Cleaning available during stay"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Paid parking lot on premises \u2013 1 space"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Self check-in"", ""Hot water"", ""TV"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Central air conditioning"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Smart lock"", ""First aid kit""]",$40.00,28,365,28,28,1125,1125,28.0,1125.0,,t,8,24,28,300,2023-07-01,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,f,3,0,3,0,

Thank you for visiting our host profile!
I am a real estate investor living in New Jersey. While I’m not fixing and flipping homes, I’m probably appreciating art at a local gallery or traveling the country and the world.  
 
Through the Airbnb hosting endeavor, I aim to provide the best possible experience to all visitors through excellent service and quality local recommendations!. There is nothing more reassuring and calming than finding a place that feels like a second home on your travels.
 
Feel free to book or message me first; I am friendly, outgoing, and happy to answer any specific questions in advance.
 
I am a well-traveled guest who knows what a host should do to create a comfortable experience. My goal is to fulfill these requirements for every guest.
 
Experience Orlando with me!
 
Hope to host you soon!
