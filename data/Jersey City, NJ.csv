Many of the buildings where our apartments are located feature amenities such as beautiful lobbies, 24 hour front desk staff, fitness centers, business centers, recreation rooms, indoor or outdoor pools and whirlpools. If you are traveling with children, some buildings offer playgrounds (many buildings are near public playgrounds as well) or indoor playrooms. Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly. You can also make local and toll-free phone calls at no charge. 

Please contact us to confirm the exact availability of the apartment you are interested in. We’d love to host you (and your family) for your vacation or business trip.

My name is Ryan and I am an educator. I lived in Brooklyn and Manhattan for many years and moved to my current apartment in Jersey City four years ago.

I enjoy traveling a lot so when my apartment is available it's usually because I am off on an adventures somewhere else. When I'm home, I am enjoying all that NYC and Jersey City have to offer. 

Jersey City is great! It's pretty much like living in another borough of the city and am super happy here. There is a lot to do in the area and with the Journal Square path close by and NJ transit bus up the block, you can be in the city in 30 minutes door-to-door. I hope you get to enjoy my place!

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well!

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

During my free time, I am either building a website or playing with my son.  I love playing ping pong and walking during my free time, which I hope I could do more of. 

I'm originally from India and now in the US for more than 15 years. My favorite food is Indian biryani, cream cheese bagels, pizzas, and Mediterranean food. As you can see nothing extraordinary as I belong to the tribe that thinks we need to eat to live and not live to eat :). 

As a host, I love meeting new people from various cultures, and backgrounds and feel good to know that I have helped them in some small way to have a pleasant and memorable trip. I have visited a number of places in the US, Singapore, and India and know quite well how stressful it can be. I hope to see Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East in the near future. 

I look forward to helping you have a pleasant and safe stay so you can meet your travel goals, be it personal or business.

After living in different countries across the globe, we decided to buy a second home in one of the most special places for us, somewhere we always returned to no matter where we were: Florida.

We realized that one of the things we enjoyed the most about Disney (and Universal as well) is the experience, the transportation to other worlds that help us to disconnect from our routine. With that in mind, we created an experience out of our house, adding personal touches, hand-selected decoration and a personality to each room. After finishing our project, we realized that it was something we wanted to share with people that like us, came to Florida for the overall experience.

We have been Airbnb hosts in London, Mexico City, NYC and Lisbon. We have stayed in many cities more and we have met amazing people on this community. We hope we can share our house with equally great people that will enjoy and take care of our home as their own.

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well!

Hello, and welcome to our home. My husband and I would be so happy to host you in our newly constructed Jersey City condo. We both share a huge passion for travel, and we have been blessed to live and visit many places all over the world. Chris and I decided to root ourselves in the city that has so much to offer which is Jersey City. While settling here, we decided to give our fellow travel lovers a place that feels like home. With southern hospitality in our roots, we have a deep love for hosting, and we look forward to extending that love and warmth to our new friends.
Our modern, sun-drenched condo offers a tranquil vibe, which is perfect to come home to after a long day of exploring the city. This location is perfect for families who want to visit Jersey City  or New York area. The location is prime for any sports enthusiasts as we are a quick fifteen-minute drive to MetLife stadium—home of the New York Giants and New York Jets. The area is also suited for travel healthcare professionals, as we are near many hospitals including Jersey City hospital. Newark international airport is a quick twelve-minute drive and in thirty minutes you are in the BIG APPLE! New York City.

It is located 35/40 minutes away from NYC which was particularly important to me. While being on a busy commercial block we are located near various convince stores and shopping centers you may hear street traffic during the day. As well as being minutes away from the night life in both Jersey City, Newark, and Bayonne. There are many attractions we are in proximity to such as the prudential theater, MET Life, Top Golf and American Dream are only 30-45 minutes away. The neighborhood is far from quiet and Surburban.

I’m from Chicago and I live in Jersey City (Journal Square section) now.  I lived in Manhattan for a few years and when I was able to buy something I chose Jersey City. It’s  a very cool place and is a shorter trip to NYC than most of Brooklyn. I'm listing my place while I do some cosmetic work on the space upstairs (no noisy work).  I also travel quite a bit so I thought I would host. I’ve got a magical and freaky bald dog (I failed at my first time fostering. He never left.) so, of course, your pet is welcome. I’m Ukrainian and plan on signing up for the Airbnb refugee hosting program which I’m very excited about. I’m responsible and chill and like making people feel welcome.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

Plus the accessibility to stores, shops, arts, theatre, shopping is at your fingertips!

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.
